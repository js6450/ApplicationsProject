## Project Description ##

Carterâ€™s Open Space Project delivers a visualization of the universe by combining a variety of data sources and inputs together. Our multi-media art presentation reveals a vibrant New York through a variety of inputs. The scenes become more discernible as the inputs adjust, similar to a newborn baby adjusting to sensory overload or the Open Space Project computing new universe visualizations.
